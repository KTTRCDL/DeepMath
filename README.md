## üî• News

- **April 14, 2025**: We release the **`DeepMath-103K`**, a large-scale training dataset tailered for RL and SFT with challenging, verifiable and decontaminated math problems. We open source:
  - ü§ó Model weights: comming soon
  - ü§ó Training data: [`DeepMath-103K`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zwhe99/DeepMath-103K)
  - üíª Code: [`DeepMath`](https://github.com/zwhe99/DeepMath)
  - üìù Data curation process: [`arXiv`](https://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxxx)

## üìñ Overview

**Challenging**: DeepMath-103K features a high concentration of difficult mathematical problems (Levels 5-9), significantly exceeding the complexity found in typical open datasets.

**Data Sample**: Each data sample in \method{} is intentionally structured to be comprehensive, supporting a variety of downstream applications in mathematical reasoning research:

* Question: The mathematical problem statement.
* Final Answer: A verifiable final answer, crucial for enabling rule-based reward functions in RL settings.
* Difficulty: A numerical difficulty score, which facilitates techniques like difficulty-aware training (e.g., curriculum learning) or adaptive compute allocation based on problem complexity.
* Topic: A hierarchical topic classification for the problem, enabling topic-specific analysis or training.
* R1 Solutions: Three distinct reasoning paths generated by the DeepSeek-R1 model.
